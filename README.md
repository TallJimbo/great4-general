# Discussion and Planning for GREAT4

GREAT4 is the Fourth GRavitational lEnsing accuracy testing project, a cross-survey effort to diagnose and improve systematic effects in weak gravitational lensing.  Unlike its successors (STEP1, STEP2, GREAT08, GREAT10, GREAT3), it is currently unclear whether GREAT4 will actually contain a challenge component; the first stage will focus exclusively on simulation software and input datasets that could enable such a challenge.

This repository is primarily for discussion, announcements, and planning (mostly via the [Issues tab](https://github.com/TallJimbo/great4-general/issues)).  We expect most new code to ultimately land in the existing [GalSim](https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim) package, though this may be revisited in the future as more concrete plans develop.

Anyone interested in contributing to GREAT4 or simply tracking its progress is encouraged to "Watch" the repository.
